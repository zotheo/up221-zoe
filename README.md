## Zoe Frumin
I am a second year Masters of Urban and Regional Planning Student at UCLA. Before moving to Los Angeles I lived in Seattle and worked on a park project along the downtown waterfront. Before living in Seattle I was a kid growing up in DC ðŸ™ƒ In my free time I like to explore the city and eat lots of food.

## Course Description & Class Objectives
I am taking UP221 GIS and Spatial Data Science this quarter to learn some skills in spatial data analysis. I love to look at different maps and data visualizations to understand urban planning challenges and want to be able to create accessible and informative maps after taking this class. 

## Project Ideas
For my capstone I am studying street vendors in public space and how cities can better support the informal economy in the public realm. This project touches on some interests I am hoping to explore in this class
- access to quality green space and the public realm
- the informal economy's potential role in addressing green gentrification
