I am a second year Masters of Urban and Regional Planning Student at UCLA. I am taking a class in GIS and Spatial Data Science to learn some skills in spataial data analysis. For my capstone I am studying vendors in public space and how cities can better support the informal economy in the public realm. This project touches on two of my interests, access to quality green space and the public realm, and the informal economy's potential role in addressing green gentrification.
