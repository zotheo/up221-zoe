I am a second year Masters of Urban and Regional Planning Student at UCLA. I am taking a class in GIS and Spatial Data Science to learn some skills in spataial data analysis. For my capstone I am studying vendors in public space and how cities can better support the informal economy in the public realm. This project touches on some interests I am hoping to explore in this class
- access to quality green space and the public realm
- the informal economy's potential role in addressing green gentrification
